## Work Breakdown

### EPIC 1: AI Canvas Agent (25 points) ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL

**Priority:** HIGHEST - This is 25% of total grade and completely missing

**Goal:** Implement AI agent that manipulates canvas through natural language

#### Requirements Breakdown:

**Command Breadth (10pts target: 9-10pts)**
- Need 8+ distinct command types covering:
  - Creation (2+): "Create red circle at 100,200", "Add text 'Hello'"
  - Manipulation (2+): "Move blue rectangle to center", "Resize circle 2x"
  - Layout (1+): "Arrange shapes in horizontal row", "Create 3x3 grid"
  - Complex (1+): "Create login form", "Build navigation bar"

**Complex Execution (8pts target: 7-8pts)**
- "Create login form" must produce 3+ properly arranged elements
- Smart positioning and styling
- Multi-step plan execution

**Performance & Reliability (7pts target: 6-7pts)**
- Sub-2 second responses
- 90%+ accuracy
- Natural UX with feedback
- Shared state across users
- Multiple users can use AI simultaneously

#### Implementation Plan:

**Phase 1: Basic AI Integration (Days 1-2)**
- [ ] Choose AI provider (OpenAI GPT-4 or Anthropic Claude)
- [ ] Set up API integration
- [ ] Create AI service layer (`aiService.js`)
- [ ] Implement function calling/tool use schema
- [ ] Define tools: `createShape`, `updateShape`, `getCanvasState`, `deleteShape`
- [ ] Create AI chat UI component (input box + chat history)
- [ ] Test basic commands: "Create a red rectangle"

**Phase 2: Command Coverage (Days 2-3)**
- [ ] Implement creation commands (5+ variations)
- [ ] Implement manipulation commands (5+ variations)
- [ ] Implement layout commands (3+ variations)
- [ ] Test each category thoroughly
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic

**Phase 3: Complex Commands (Day 3)**
- [ ] Implement multi-step planning for complex commands
- [ ] "Create login form" â†’ analyze â†’ plan â†’ execute (username field, password field, button, arranged vertically)
- [ ] "Build navigation bar" â†’ create multiple items, arrange horizontally, style consistently
- [ ] Add smart defaults (sizing, spacing, colors)

**Phase 4: Shared State & Multi-User (Day 4)**
- [ ] AI-generated shapes sync via existing Firestore infrastructure
- [ ] Multiple users can issue AI commands simultaneously
- [ ] Show AI activity to other users (presence indicator?)
- [ ] Test with 2+ users using AI at same time

**Phase 5: UX Polish (Day 4)**
- [ ] Add loading states ("AI is thinking...")
- [ ] Show AI plan before execution ("I'll create 3 elements...")
- [ ] Add feedback messages on success/failure
- [ ] Implement chat history
- [ ] Add example prompts for users

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- **Tool Schema:** Define clear function signatures for AI to call
- **State Management:** AI operations go through same `canvasService` as manual edits
- **Prompt Engineering:** System prompt that teaches AI about canvas coordinates, sizing, layout principles
- **Context:** Pass current canvas state to AI so it knows what exists

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 days (40-50% of remaining work)

---

### EPIC 2: Performance Improvements (6-8 points gain)

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for excellent marks in Section 1

**Current State:**
- Cursor sync: ~200ms (need sub-50ms for 11-12pts)
- Object sync: ~200ms (need sub-100ms for 11-12pts)
- Untested at scale (500+ objects, 5+ users)

#### Tasks:

**Phase 1: Migrate to Realtime Database (Days 1-2)**
- [ ] Enable Firebase Realtime Database in console
- [ ] Migrate cursors to RTDB (keep shapes in Firestore)
- [ ] Migrate presence to RTDB with native `onDisconnect`
- [ ] Test latency improvements (target: 30-50ms for cursors)
- [ ] Update security rules for RTDB

**Phase 2: Optimization (Day 2)**
- [ ] Implement cursor interpolation (smooth movement between updates)
- [ ] Add viewport culling (don't render off-screen shapes)
- [ ] Optimize Firestore queries (indexes, pagination if needed)
- [ ] Batch shape updates where possible

**Phase 3: Scale Testing (Day 3)**
- [ ] Create test script to generate 500+ shapes
- [ ] Test FPS with 500 objects (target: 60 FPS)
- [ ] Test with 5+ concurrent users
- [ ] Profile and optimize bottlenecks
- [ ] Document performance characteristics

**Expected Gains:**
- Real-time sync: 6-8pts â†’ 11-12pts (+4-5pts)
- Performance: 5-6pts â†’ 9-10pts (+3-4pts)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

### EPIC 3: Advanced Figma Features (10-12 points target)

**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - 15% of grade, relatively quick wins

**Strategy:** Implement 3 Tier 1 + 2 Tier 2 features for 12pts

#### Tier 1 Features (Pick 3, 6pts total)

**Recommended:**
1. **Undo/Redo** (2pts) - HIGH IMPACT
   - [ ] Implement command pattern or history stack
   - [ ] Track all shape operations
   - [ ] Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z keyboard shortcuts
   - [ ] Sync undo/redo across users (tricky!)

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts** (2pts) - EASY WIN
   - [ ] Delete/Backspace (already have)
   - [ ] Duplicate: Cmd+D
   - [ ] Arrow keys to nudge selected shape
   - [ ] Cmd+A to select all
   - [ ] Escape to deselect

3. **Export Canvas** (2pts) - MEDIUM EFFORT
   - [ ] Export to PNG using Konva's built-in export
   - [ ] Export selected shapes or entire canvas
   - [ ] Download button in toolbar

**Alternatives:**
- Copy/paste (Cmd+C/V)
- Color picker with recent colors/palettes
- Snap-to-grid

#### Tier 2 Features (Pick 2, 6pts total)

**Recommended:**
1. **Layers Panel** (3pts) - HIGH IMPACT, VISIBLE
   - [ ] Sidebar showing all shapes as list
   - [ ] Click to select shape
   - [ ] Drag to reorder (z-index)
   - [ ] Show/hide shapes (visibility toggle)
   - [ ] Rename shapes

2. **Alignment Tools** (3pts) - USEFUL, MODERATE EFFORT
   - [ ] Toolbar buttons: align left/right/center/top/bottom
   - [ ] Distribute evenly (horizontal/vertical)
   - [ ] Align relative to canvas or selection

**Alternatives:**
- Z-index management (bring to front, send to back) - could combine with layers panel
- Styles/design tokens (save and reuse colors)

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days total

---

### EPIC 4: Additional Shape Types & Features

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Improves Section 2 score

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Add text layers with basic formatting
  - [ ] Font size picker
  - [ ] Font family dropdown
  - [ ] Text color
  - [ ] Edit text on double-click
- [ ] Add line/arrow shapes
- [ ] Test multi-select (Shift+click) - may already work with Konva Transformer
- [ ] Add rotation UI (may already work with Konva Transformer)

**Expected Gains:**
- Canvas functionality: 3-4pts â†’ 6-7pts (+2-3pts)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **AI Agent Implementation** (NEW technology, 25pts at stake)
   - Mitigation: Start immediately, test incrementally, have fallback simpler implementation
   
2. **Demo Video Quality** (Pass/fail, -10pts if poor)
   - Mitigation: Record early, get feedback, reshoot if needed
   
3. **Performance at Scale** (500+ objects target)
   - Mitigation: Test early, optimize progressively, document limits if can't hit target

### Medium-Risk Items
4. **Undo/Redo with Multi-User** (Complex feature)
