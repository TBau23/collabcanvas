# Multi-Select Foundation - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Epic**: Collaboration UX Improvements - Feature 1

---

## Summary

Implemented multi-select foundation enabling users to select and manipulate multiple shapes simultaneously. This is the foundational feature that enables all subsequent group operations.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Layer (`rtdbService.js`)
- Changed selection schema from `shapeId: string` to `shapeIds: string[]`
- Updated `updateSelection()` to broadcast array of selected shape IDs
- RTDB path remains: `sessions/{canvasId}/selections/{userId}`

**Schema (Before)**:
```javascript
{
  shapeId: "033d1793-ba4c-4c96-9b...",
  userName: "fig",
  color: "#3498DB",
  updatedAt: 1760904648656
}
```

**Schema (After)**:
```javascript
{
  shapeIds: ["033d1793-...", "abc123-..."],
  userName: "fig",
  color: "#3498DB",
  updatedAt: 1760904648656
}
```

### 2. Canvas State (`Canvas.jsx`)
- Changed `selectedId` → `selectedIds: string[]` throughout component
- Added marquee selection state:
  - `isMarqueeSelecting: boolean`
  - `marqueeStart: {x, y}`
  - `marqueeCurrent: {x, y}`

### 3. Selection Interactions

**Single Click**:
- Click shape → Replace selection with that shape
- Click empty canvas → Deselect all

**Modifier Keys**:
- Shift + Click shape → Add/remove shape from selection
- Cmd/Ctrl + Click shape → Add/remove shape from selection

**Marquee Selection**:
- Click + drag on empty canvas → Draw selection box
- All shapes intersecting box are selected on mouse up
- Dashed blue rectangle with 10% fill during drag

### 4. Visual Rendering

**Local Selection**:
- All selected shapes show blue outline (3px)
- Transformer attaches to first selected shape

**Remote Selection**:
- Shows colored outlines for shapes selected by other users
- Supports both old format (`shapeId`) and new format (`shapeIds`) for compatibility
- Multiple users can select overlapping shapes (all outlines visible)

### 5. Updated Operations

**Delete (Backspace/Delete)**:
- Deletes all selected shapes
- Batch operation to Firestore

**Color Change**:
- Applies to all selected shapes
- Batch operation to Firestore

**Bring to Front / Send to Back**:
- Moves all selected shapes together
- Maintains relative z-order within selection

**Tool Change**:
- Switching away from select tool clears selection

## Technical Details

### Viewport Culling
- Updated `getVisibleShapes()` to work with `selectedIds` array
- Always renders all selected shapes (critical for Transformer)

### Transformer Behavior
- Attaches to first selected shape only (Feature 2 will add group transformations)
- Color picker updates to match first selected shape's color

### Drag Behavior
- Currently works on individual shapes only
- Feature 2 will enable group dragging

## Testing Checklist

✅ Single-click selection  
✅ Shift+click to add/remove shapes  
✅ Cmd+click to add/remove shapes  
✅ Marquee selection box appears and selects intersecting shapes  
✅ Click empty canvas deselects all  
✅ Delete key removes all selected shapes  
✅ Color change applies to all selected shapes  
✅ Bring to front/back works with multiple shapes  
✅ Remote selections visible with multiple users  
✅ No linter errors

## Known Limitations (By Design)

These are intentionally out of scope for Feature 1:

1. **No group transformations** - Can only resize/rotate first selected shape
2. **No group drag** - Dragging moves only the clicked shape
3. **No selection bounding box** - Only individual shape outlines shown
4. **No copy/paste** - Requires Feature 3

---

## Next Steps

**Ready for Feature 2: Group Transformations**
- Drag all selected shapes together (maintain relative positions)
- Calculate and display selection bounding box
- Batch transform operations to RTDB for live preview

---

## Migration Notes

**No backward compatibility needed** - No users on production yet.

If old data exists in RTDB with `shapeId` format, the rendering code gracefully handles it by checking for both `shapeIds` (new) and `shapeId` (old) fields.
