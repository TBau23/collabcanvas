# Database Architecture & Real-Time Collaboration Research

## Overview
This Figma clone implements a **hybrid database architecture** combining Firebase Firestore (persistent state) and Firebase Realtime Database (ephemeral real-time state) to optimize for both data persistence and low-latency collaboration.

---

## Database Architecture

### 1. Firestore (Persistent Storage)
**Purpose**: Source of truth for permanent canvas state

**Structure**:
```
canvases/{canvasId}/
  └── objects/{objectId}  // Shape documents
      ├── id: string
      ├── type: "rectangle" | "ellipse" | "text"
      ├── x, y: number (position)
      ├── width, height: number
      ├── fill: string (color)
      ├── rotation: number
      ├── zIndex: number (layer order)
      ├── locked: boolean
      ├── visible: boolean
      ├── updatedBy: string (userId)
      ├── updatedAt: number (timestamp)
      └── text?: string (for text type)
      └── fontSize?: number (for text type)
```

**Operations**:
- `createShape()`: Creates new shape document with `setDoc()`
- `updateShape()`: Updates shape properties with `setDoc(..., {merge: true})`
- `deleteShape()`: Removes shape document with `deleteDoc()`
- `subscribeToShapes()`: Real-time listener with `onSnapshot()` on entire collection

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Latency: ~200-400ms for writes, ~100-300ms for snapshot updates
- Triggers component re-renders on any shape change
- All authenticated users have full read/write access (MVP security model)

### 2. Realtime Database (Ephemeral State)
**Purpose**: Ultra-low latency for transient collaboration signals

**Structure**:
```
sessions/{canvasId}/
  ├── cursors/{userId}
  │   ├── x, y: number
  │   ├── userName: string
  │   ├── color: string
  │   └── updatedAt: number
  │
  ├── presence/{userId}
  │   ├── userName: string
  │   ├── online: true (always true - removed on disconnect)
  │   ├── color: string
  │   └── lastSeen: number
  │
  ├── dragging/{shapeId}
  │   ├── userId: string
  │   ├── x, y, width, height, rotation: number
  │   └── updatedAt: number
  │
  └── selections/{userId}
      ├── shapeIds: string[] (array of selected shape IDs)
      ├── userName: string
      ├── color: string
      └── updatedAt: number
```

**Operations**:
- **Cursors**: `updateCursorRTDB()` throttled at 50ms, `subscribeToCursorsRTDB()`
- **Presence**: `setUserOnlineRTDB()`, `subscribeToPresenceRTDB()`, auto-cleanup on disconnect
- **Dragging**: `updateTransformState()` throttled at 50ms per shape, `subscribeToDragging()`
- **Selections**: `updateSelection()`, `subscribeToSelections()`, auto-cleanup on disconnect

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Latency: ~10-50ms for writes, ~20-100ms for listener updates
- Throttled to prevent network flooding (50ms for cursors/dragging)
- Uses `onDisconnect()` handlers for automatic cleanup when clients disconnect

## Data Flow Patterns

### Shape Creation Flow
1. **User clicks** canvas → `handleStageClick()` triggered
2. **Optimistic update**: Shape added to local state immediately via `setShapes([...shapes, newShape])`
3. **Persist**: `createShape()` writes to Firestore (async, ~200ms)
4. **Broadcast**: Firestore `onSnapshot()` notifies all clients (~300ms total)
5. **Reconciliation**: Canvas merges remote shape with local state using `updatedAt` timestamps

**Performance Impact**:
- User sees instant feedback (0ms perceived latency)
- Other users see shape appear in ~300-500ms
- Risk: If Firestore write fails, optimistic update creates UI/DB inconsistency

### Shape Transformation Flow (Drag/Resize)
**Two-Phase Sync Strategy**:

**Phase 1: Real-Time Preview (during drag)**
1. `handleShapeDragMove()` → `updateTransformState()` writes to RTDB
2. Throttled at 50ms per shape (20 updates/second max)
3. Other clients receive via `subscribeToDragging()` in ~20-50ms
4. Remote shapes rendered with `remoteDragging` overlay (orange outline, 70% opacity)
5. Local state updated optimistically for smooth rendering

**Phase 2: Persistence (on drag end)**
1. `handleShapeDragEnd()` → `updateShape()` writes final position to Firestore
2. `clearDraggingPosition()` removes RTDB entry after 300ms delay (prevents flicker)
3. Firestore snapshot updates all clients with authoritative position
4. RTDB cleanup ensures stale dragging state doesn't persist

**Performance Impact**:
- Smooth 20fps real-time preview for remote users
- Final position persisted reliably
- 300ms overlap between RTDB and Firestore prevents visual glitches
- Per-shape throttling enables multi-shape group drags without bottleneck

### Selection & Cursor Flow
1. **Local selection**: `setSelectedIds()` → immediate UI update
2. **Broadcast**: `updateSelection()` writes to RTDB with shape IDs array
3. **Remote rendering**: Other clients show colored bounding box + username tag
4. **Cursor tracking**: Mouse movement throttled at 50ms → RTDB → rendered as colored circles
5. **Auto-cleanup**: `onDisconnect()` handlers remove cursors/selections when user leaves

**Performance Impact**:
- ~20 cursor updates/second per user (50ms throttle)
- With 10 users: 200 RTDB writes/second (well within Firebase limits)
- Selections don't throttle (only change on click, not continuous)

### AI Command Flow
1. User enters command → `sendCommand()` in `aiService.js`
2. **Context optimization**: Only sends canvas state if command references existing shapes (`needsCanvasState()`)
3. **Cloud function**: Calls `callAI` Firebase function with OpenAI API
4. **Tool execution**: AI returns function calls (createShape, updateShape, etc.)
5. **Parallel execution**: All tool calls executed via `Promise.all()` for max speed
6. **Batch writes**: `createMultipleShapes` uses Firestore `writeBatch()` for atomic multi-shape creation
7. **Optimistic update**: Returns created shapes to Canvas for immediate local rendering

**Performance Impact**:
- Canvas state optimization reduces payload size by ~60-80% for simple commands
- Parallel tool execution reduces multi-shape operations from sequential (n*200ms) to parallel (~200ms)
- Batch writes reduce 10-shape creation from 2000ms to ~250ms
- Optimistic updates provide instant AI feedback while Firestore syncs in background

## Connection Management & Cleanup

### Connection State Tracking
- `isConnected` flag tracks RTDB connection via `.info/connected` listener
- `waitForConnection()` promises used to defer `onDisconnect()` registration until connected
- Critical: `onDisconnect()` handlers fail silently if registered while disconnected

### Cleanup Strategy (Dual Approach)
**1. Automatic Cleanup (onDisconnect handlers)**
- Registered in `setupCursorCleanup()`, `setupSelectionCleanup()`, `setUserOnlineRTDB()`
- Fires on tab close, browser crash, network disconnect
- Removes presence, cursors, selections from RTDB automatically

**2. Manual Cleanup (explicit logout)**
- `authService.logout()` calls `setUserOfflineRTDB()`, `deleteCursorRTDB()`, `clearSelection()` BEFORE signOut()
- Critical: Cleanup happens while auth token still valid (RTDB security rules require auth.uid match)
- Ensures immediate cleanup vs waiting for Firebase to detect disconnect (~30s delay)

### Reconnection Handling
- `subscribeToConnectionState()` listener in Canvas component
- On reconnect: Re-registers all onDisconnect handlers (they're cleared on disconnect)
- Re-writes presence with `setUserOnlineRTDB()` to mark user back online

**Performance Impact**:
- Manual cleanup provides instant offline state (0ms)
- onDisconnect cleanup provides reliability (handles crashes)
- Reconnection re-registration prevents "ghost users" appearing online after network hiccup

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Throttling
- **Cursors**: 50ms (max 20 updates/second/user)
- **Dragging**: 50ms per shape (supports group drags without global bottleneck)
- **Why**: Prevents RTDB write flooding, reduces network usage by ~95%

### 2. Viewport Culling
- `getVisibleShapes()` filters shapes outside viewport bounds
- Adds 200px margin for smooth scrolling
- Always renders selected/dragging shapes (critical for Transformer)
- **Impact**: With 1000 shapes, renders ~50-100 (95% reduction), dramatic FPS improvement

### 3. Optimistic Updates
- All create/update/delete operations update local state before Firestore
- User sees instant feedback (0ms perceived latency)
- Firestore acts as eventual consistency + persistence layer
- **Risk**: Failed writes create temporary UI/DB mismatch until next snapshot

### 4. Batch Operations
- `writeBatch()` for AI multi-shape creation (atomic, single network round trip)
- Copy/paste operations batch-create shapes
- **Impact**: 10-shape creation: 2000ms → 250ms (8x faster)

### 5. Canvas State Optimization (AI)
- `needsCanvasState()` determines if command references existing shapes
- `optimizeCanvasState()` sends only essential fields (id, type, x, y, fill)
- Filters invalid shapes, truncates long text to 50 chars
- **Impact**: Payload size reduction 60-80%, faster Cloud Function execution, lower token costs

### 6. Grid Rendering Optimization
- Single `<Shape>` component with canvas drawing vs 200 individual `<Line>` components
- Reduces React reconciliation overhead
- Marked `listening={false}` to skip event handling

### 7. Parallel Tool Execution
- AI tool calls execute via `Promise.all()` instead of sequential await
- **Impact**: 5 operations: 1000ms → 200ms (5x faster)

## Security Model

### Firestore Rules
- Authenticated users: Full read/write on all shapes
- User-specific data (cursors/presence): Write limited to own userId
- MVP model: No per-shape ownership, any user can modify any shape

### RTDB Rules
- Authenticated users: Full read on all paths
- Cursors/presence/selections: Write limited to own userId with `auth.uid === $userId`
- Dragging: Any authenticated user can write (enables collaborative editing)
- `|| !newData.exists()` clause allows deletion by any user (cleanup)

**Security Gaps (MVP Acceptable)**:
- No shape-level permissions
- No canvas-level access control
- Any authenticated user can delete any shape
- No rate limiting on writes (vulnerable to abuse)

---

## Performance Bottlenecks & Trade-offs

### Identified Bottlenecks
1. **Firestore snapshot updates**: Every shape change triggers full collection re-sync
   - With 100 shapes: ~10-30KB per update
   - Impacts: Network bandwidth, client-side diffing overhead

2. **React re-renders**: Every shape change causes Canvas component re-render
   - Mitigated by viewport culling, but still processes full shape array

3. **Transformer updates**: Selected shapes need constant re-attachment to Transformer
   - `useEffect` dependency on `[selectedIds, shapes]` fires frequently

4. **RTDB cursor broadcasts**: With 50 users, 1000 writes/second to single RTDB node
   - Firebase limit: ~10k writes/second/node, so safe, but approach limits

### Trade-offs
1. **Optimistic updates vs consistency**: 
   - Pro: Instant feedback
   - Con: Temporary mismatch if Firestore write fails

2. **Throttling vs real-time accuracy**:
   - Pro: 95% bandwidth reduction
   - Con: Cursor/drag updates lag by up to 50ms (acceptable for humans)

3. **Hybrid database vs single database**:
   - Pro: Optimal latency for each data type (persistent vs ephemeral)
   - Con: Complexity in managing two data sources, potential sync issues

4. **Global canvas state vs incremental updates**:
   - Pro: Simple mental model, easy to reason about
   - Con: Doesn't scale to 10k+ shapes (need data partitioning)

5. **Full collection subscriptions vs targeted queries**:
   - Pro: Always have full canvas state, simple to implement
   - Con: All clients download all shapes (doesn't scale to 100+ collaborators with complex canvases)

---

## Scalability Limits

### Current Architecture Can Handle:
- **Shapes**: ~1,000 shapes before viewport culling becomes critical
- **Users**: ~50 concurrent users before RTDB writes become bottleneck
- **Canvas size**: 5000x5000px fixed size (no infinite canvas)

### Would Break With:
- **10,000+ shapes**: Firestore snapshots become too large (~1-3MB), client-side diffing too slow
- **100+ users**: RTDB cursor writes approach limit (5000+ writes/second), Firestore document contention
- **Multiple canvases**: Current hardcoded `CANVAS_ID = 'main-canvas'`, no routing

### Migration Path for Scale:
1. **Spatial partitioning**: Load shapes by viewport region (Firestore queries with geo filters)
2. **Incremental sync**: Use Firestore document listeners vs collection, track change deltas
3. **WebRTC data channels**: Peer-to-peer cursor/selection sync for 100+ users
4. **Serverless CRDT**: Conflict-free replicated data types for true offline-first
5. **Canvas sharding**: Multiple canvases with routing, user presence per-canvas

## Key Insights

### What Works Well
1. **Hybrid database** elegantly separates concerns: Firestore = source of truth, RTDB = collaboration signals
2. **Throttling** prevents network flooding while maintaining perceived real-time responsiveness
3. **onDisconnect handlers** provide reliable cleanup without server-side code
4. **Optimistic updates** create Figma-like instant feedback despite network latency
5. **Viewport culling** is essential for smooth rendering with hundreds of shapes

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Firestore granularity**: Full collection snapshots don't scale; need per-document listeners
2. **Cursor aggregation**: With many users, consider spatial hashing to reduce render overhead
3. **Conflict resolution**: Concurrent edits use "last write wins" (simple but lossy)
4. **Connection diagnostics**: Extensive logging (good for debugging, should be feature-flagged)
5. **Error handling**: Optimistic updates have no retry or rollback on Firestore failure

### Architectural Decisions & Rationale
1. **Why Firestore + RTDB**: Firestore alone has too much latency for cursors, RTDB alone doesn't persist data
2. **Why 50ms throttle**: Balance between smoothness (20fps) and network efficiency
3. **Why optimistic updates**: Mimics native app feel, critical for competitive product experience
4. **Why viewport culling**: React/Konva can't efficiently render 1000+ DOM nodes at 60fps
5. **Why batch writes**: Firestore charges per operation, batch writes reduce cost + improve atomicity
