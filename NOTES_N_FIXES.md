-- agent is not using the colors I have defined, broadly we should just be using a more universal color palette
-- agent chat should not block the main canvas, it should be a modal that can be closed and opened again
-- canvas should open to the center of the canvas, not the top left
-- shape updating is now working to some extent, but if I say something like "move the blue circle down 1000 pixels, it will also move other blue shapes (even squares) down 1000 pixels
-- the return message from the agent probably shouldnt say the ID!
-- clean up console.logs
-- how much benefit is there to using firestore real time db - the existing one is pretty snappy but not sure.
- noticing some strange behavior with transforms - if i drag across the y axis, it resizes strangely
- probs need a way to change font size and font family
- probs need a way to change the font color

--prescence indicator not working always ? 
-- requests to do something like delete a circle just get a response identifying where it is, but not deleting it. Some things probably have to be done sequentially
